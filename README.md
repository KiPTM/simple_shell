We have created several files for the  shell implementation.

 Here's a list of the files created so far and the order in which they count:

requirements.h - Defines the specified requirements for the shell.
requirements.c - Provides the initial code for the shell based on the specified requirements.
command_parser.h - Defines functions for parsing and executing commands with arguments.
command_parser.c - Implements the functions for parsing and executing commands with arguments.
main.c - Contains the main code for the shell, which uses the command_parser functions to handle user input.
